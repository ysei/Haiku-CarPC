Haiku-CarPC
===========

Native application to use Haiku as a Car PC. This connects to BMW I-BUS (a
special bus dedicated to "multimedia" features of the car, which is not too
dangerous to mess with) to collect some data, analyze it, and display it in an
useful way.

This is also an example of how Haiku APIs can be used to easily build a
real-world application. We need more of those!
